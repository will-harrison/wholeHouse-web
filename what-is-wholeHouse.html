            <h2>One app to rule them all.</h2>
            <p class="lead">Why do we have so many apps? Why do we have so many ways to send someone a message? Why are there so many unintuitive steps to view my kids' calendars?</p>
            <p>wholeHouse combines user information, notifications, location, time, and lists - and connects them all in an seamless, intuitive experience.</p>
            <p>We're building an app that connects your (private) data together. That means wholeHouse can make sense of your life.</p>

        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h2>One platform for all devices.</h2>
            <p class="lead">My phone doesn't know anything about my tablet, that doesn't know anything about my desktop computer, that doesn't know anything about my work computer, my TV, my car, my ...</p>
            <p>wholeHouse is a central server that all of your devices view in real time. Now, your phone, table, computer, and eventually TV, car, alarm clock... are in sync - all the time, without your intervention.</p>

        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h2>It lives on your own <em>private</em> cloud.</h2>
            <p class="lead">We can host a very inexpensive, private, secure virual machine - if you have no idea what I just said.</p>
            <p>Or you can host it yourself.</p>
            <p>I'm developing on a raspberry pi on my shelf.</p>

            <p>The point is that your data is yours. I don't want it, I don't want to sell it.</p>

        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h2>Open source, with an app store built in.</h2>
            <p class="lead">That means people who care about the project can contribute new and useful ways to interact with wH.</p>
            <p>That means we can focus on building a solid core service while people dream up ways to use wH that we could never think of.</p>
